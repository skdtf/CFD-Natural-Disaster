Idea- On the very Important topic "Find better ways to save lives and prevent economic losses through mechanisms to predict, prevent, or manage the impact of natural disasters." 

# We will work on our project named "E-Aapda".

For Detailed prescription of Idea move to line no ()

India, owing to its geography is prone to hazards. The collision zone of the Indo plate with the Asian plate (that also gives India the mighty Himalayas) sees a lot of seismic activity (or earthquakes).We suffered a lot from Gujarat Earthquake in 2001.

Thereâ€™s a volcano in Indian territory in the islands of Andaman and Nicobar and that could also become active anytime.

India has a significant coastline exceeding 7000 Km. Any significant seismic activity in the Indian Ocean could cause ripples in the ocean/seas that could make the seas violent and bring about giant waves or what we could call tsunamis. We suffered a lot from Tsunami 2004.

Also there was a lot of loss of human life and economy by Kerala floods.

# PROJECT DESCRIPTION

We aim to build a web application and a portal for people around the nation for minimizing human loss and economical losses across the nation, focussing mainly on construction of houses. We will give information about sustainable house designs,infrastructure and other preventive measures which will depend upon disaster history,topology,and other factors that can lead to natural disasters. 



# Features
1) Taking input data from people like location,Purpose of visit ( For general living , tourism, adventure activities etc)

2) If user's purpose is general living, We will give information about sustainable house designs,infrastructure and other preventive measures which will depend upon disaster history,topology,and other factors that can lead to natural disasters. 

House construction manuals will be taken from National Disaster Management Authority (India) survey conducted by 5 IITs. The link has been provided here:

3) If user's purpose is tourism, then we will display safe time period for such activites and it will predict probabilities of disasters from climate conditions, disaster history and weather reports data sets over a long time. We will try to optimize as much less error as possible. 

4) Webpage will be user-friendly, both in hindi and english. Our webpage will be designed using html,css,bootstrap. Our backend server will be hosted using Django. We will use Google Maps API for location tracing.

5) We will train data using linear regression and logistic regression algorithms for accurate predictions.
